As part of my continous journey of improving my coding skills, I create and work on differnt projects.

Finance calculator focuses on if-else statements and variables. It calculates the total potential investement and monthly mortgage repayments given user's contraints.

Task manager requests a user to log in and only continues if the username and password match in a pre-existing file. Then, depending on whether the user is the admin or not, gives several different options to choose from, such as to view, add a task or register a user.
This task involes the use of while and for loops, if-else statements, reading and adding to a file, lists and string manipulation.
